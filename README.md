# Speech to Text comparison


This repo has my first analysis using audio files and text transcriptions, where I compare the real text with IBM Watson transcription in two different audios recorded in Brazilian portuguese.

This leasson was done during my MBA classes about Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, at Faculdade de Informatica e Administração Paulista, FIAP.
